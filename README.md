# Human activity recognition based on WiFi signal
This project, focusing on human activity recognition using Channel State Information (CSI) data from WiFi signals, is the central topic of a four-month internship program within the Department of Mechanical Engineering at National Central University (NCU), Taiwan. The research aims to leverage the ubiquity of WiFi networks to develop non-invasive methods for detecting and classifying human activities.
